This following program will track the words and letters
Which will then make an algorithm to see what grade
the writer is in approximately

We are going to make the user input a string

Then we will create a function that will loop and give us
the number of letters, words, sentences and we might make functions for each of them.

We also need average of letters per 100 in text
and average sentences per 100 words

Heres our equation for letters: (Letters/words *100)
Heres our equation for sentences: (sentences/words *100)

Heres our index equation to calculate the grade the writers is in:
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
